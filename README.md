# fakereviews

This is an self-initiative project that will help to detect Spam opinions that are made across various websites for various products.
I am trying to detect all fake and non-fake reviews using Naive Bayes and SVM(Support Vector Machine).

The UI of the project will be Django.
Better algorithms will be used as project goes on. More details adding soon.
